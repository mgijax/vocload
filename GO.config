OBSOLETE_DEFINITION="If term is found that is either outside the scope of GO, misleadingly named, incorrectly defined, or is a concept that would be better represented in another way, rather than delete the term, it is made obsolete. The term and ID still exist in the GO database, but the term is marked as obsolete, and a comment added, giving a reason for it being obsoleted, and recommending alternative terms where appropriate."
